## About Me

I help organisations turn complex business problems into clearly defined, deliverable solutions — bridging the gap between what stakeholders need and what technology teams can build.

Over four years, I have worked as a **Business Analyst and Product Specialist** across enterprise AI platforms, financial services digital transformation, and data-driven product delivery — embedded within large, cross-functional teams where precise requirements and strong stakeholder alignment drive delivery outcomes.

My work spans the full lifecycle: requirements elicitation, process mapping, user story writing, backlog management, UAT coordination, and post-launch performance monitoring. I have hands-on experience evaluating **Generative AI and LLM capabilities** against real business problems and translating that analysis into roadmap decisions stakeholders can act on.

📍 Based in Galway, Ireland · Stamp 1G · Fully work-authorised · Open to BA, PM & PO roles

## Featured Project

### 🤖 [Digital Capacity Optimizer — AI-Driven Analytics Engine](https://github.com/sandesh-s-hegde/digital_capacity_optimizer)

> *Python · PostgreSQL · Google Gemini AI · GitHub Actions · CI/CD*

An end-to-end AI analytics agent built from requirements definition through to live deployment — the same end-to-end ownership I apply in professional BA and product delivery work.

- **Conversational AI agent** with multi-turn context management and intent-routing logic
- **Stochastic simulation engine** running 10,000+ iterations to stress-test decision logic against edge cases before go-live
- **Full CI/CD pipeline** via GitHub Actions for automated deployment and validation
- **SQL reporting layer** tracking platform KPIs and performance benchmarks

> This project was built to professional delivery standards — requirements first, QA frameworks before launch, measurable benchmarks throughout. It demonstrates hands-on GenAI and LLM capability, not just business-level familiarity.
